## About MammoCare

MammoCare is an advanced mammogram image processing platform designed to revolutionize breast cancer detection. It eliminates artifacts and enhances image clarity, allowing for precise early detection.  

Early detection of breast cancer significantly improves survival rates, but dense breast tissue and artifacts such as the pectoral muscle can obscure readings. MammoCare employs both **manual and automated pectoral muscle removal techniques**, including depth-first search algorithms and advanced image processing methods, to produce high-quality, artifact-free images.  

Additionally, MammoCare offers **interactive 3D visualizations**, enabling healthcare professionals to explore breast tissue layer by layer for detailed analysis. By addressing challenges like dense tissue masking, MammoCare provides a cutting-edge tool to enhance diagnostic precision and improve breast health management.
